# React useEffect Hook: Missing Dependency
This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook.  The issue arises when a dependency is omitted from the dependency array, leading to unexpected behavior and potential bugs.

## Problem
The `useEffect` hook is designed to perform side effects, such as data fetching or DOM manipulations, after every render.  However, if a value used within the `useEffect` function changes between renders and is not included in the dependency array, the effect might not update as expected.  This can lead to stale closures and incorrect state updates. 

## Solution
The correct solution is to include all values from the component's scope that are referenced inside the `useEffect` callback in the dependency array.  If no values from the component's scope are used, an empty array (`[]`) should be used to indicate that the effect should run only once after the initial render.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
